Show creators Matt and Ross Duffer said we'll see more of Elle's background and origins. It seems very likely that finding and saving Eleven will be another element that looms large in Season 2..",

The supposition is that, somehow, Eleven tore a hole in the space-time continuum, allowing bits of a potential future to flow into Hawkins to create a time loop. The future she's seeing? It's Hawkins after the site has been nuked by the U.S. government to stop the giant mutant creature from the teaser, and the Upside Down.",

She also seemed to call herself Polly — and seemed like she was calling him Jason. Veronica mentioned it the next day, but we haven’t really talked about that scene nearly enough. What was going on there? Was Betty just a little too into things and let her emotions get the best of her? Or is there something more happening here?",

Even if Ed Harris has trouble imagining the Man in Black in Samurai mode, it's a fair bet that he's one of the players on the board most familiar with that world, and could potentially serve as our gateway into the realms beyond the Western frontier.",

As the humans become accustomed to victimization after years on the top of the food chain, Stubbs and Elsie stand out as two of the few existing human characters the audience already knows and appreciates. Their story of struggle in a world ruled by robots could very well be a big part of season two.",
